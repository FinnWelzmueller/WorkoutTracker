# WorkoutTracker
Workout progress can be tracked by filling a database. 
Excersises can be added with sets, reps, weight and a description.
Progress is visualized with Dash/Plotly.
The user can control the database and access the dashboard via a web application.
## Ideas
* add average progress (from literature)
* mobile app 
* weekly/monthly summaries if wanted
